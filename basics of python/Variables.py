"""
Variable - label mapped to the object.
Rules in assigning variables:
- Must start with letter or underscore character
- Can't start with number.
- Name is case sensitive.
"""
#example

name = "mark" # Variable assigned to string
age = 9 # Variable assigned to integer
married = True #Variable assigned to Boolean
full name = name + " Smith" #Variable assigned to another variable

1.Mutable - allowed to be changed (Objects that will be edited):
2.Immutable - not allowed to be changed (Constant values that you don't want
to be changed)

- String - group of ordered characters ("Test" , "Mark" , "2020"):

Even if string contain number it's still considered as character

int("10") - convert string to integer

- Integer - number without decimal points ( 1 , 10 , 23)

- Float - number with decimal points (1.2 , 13.4 , 565.1312)

- Boolean - Compariasion value (True or False)

Build in operations for working with numbers:

 + - add
 - - subtract
 * - multiply
 / - divide
 // - integer division(dzielenie w dół)
 % - modulus - returns rest from dividing
 ** - exponent(potęgowanie)

Compariasion operations:

< - Less than
> - Greater than
<= Less than or equal
>= Greater than or equal
== equal
!= not equal
Tips:
\ - tells to python that next mark is exacly what it means. Example:
'I \'am Jacob' - used only when using single '' is used.

type - command which allows to chech what kind of variable it is.
Boolean - True or False must be written in upper case.

Python is case sensitive.

Camel case - Make bigger letter to see diffrence in two words matched together exampe:
 bigBoy

a , b , c = 1 , 3 , 4 - Method of assignig values to variables in one line. It
can be used to diffrent types of variables.

Usefull shortcuts:

+= - adding to variable specific value ex: x = x + 5 : x += 5
-= - substracting from value ex: x = x - 5 : x -= 5
*=
/=
%=
//=
**=
